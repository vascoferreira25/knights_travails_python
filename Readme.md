## Introduction
Solution to the Project 2: Knights Travails made in Python
   
## How to Run
Download the project master to a folder, navigate to the folder and execute.

```shell
cd ./knights_travails-master
python main.py
```

## How to use
Change the starting position of the knight in `calculate_moves = knight_moves([3, 3], [4, 3])`.

The coordinates represent the position on the board.

The output is printed to console:

> You made it in 3
> Paths:
>          [3, 3] - STARTING POSITION
>          [4, 5]
>          [6, 4]
>          [4, 3]
> Result:  [[4, 5], [6, 4], [4, 3]]
